PTXdist User’s Manual
=====================

This chapter should give any newbie the information he/she needs to be
able to handle any embedded Linux projects based on PTXdist. Also the
advanced user may find new valueable information.

.. include:: user_manual.inc
.. include:: user_images.inc
.. include:: user_adapting.inc

But most of the time, a user needs more detailed adaptions to be able to
fit all requirements of the new platform. At this point of time we are
no longer ordinary users of PTXdist, we become developers now.

So, right now it’s time to read the :ref:`ptx_dev_manual`
