	  D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between
	  applications. Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw
	  sockets and CORBA in terms of complexity.

	  D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages
	  (thus decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is
	  designed to be low-overhead; messages are sent using a
	  binary protocol, not using XML. D-Bus also supports a method
	  call mapping for its messages, but it is not required; this
	  makes using the system quite simple.

	  It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt
	  and Java.
