	  LTT provides its user with all the information required to
 	  reconstruct a system's behavior during a certain period of
	  time. One can know exactly the dynamics of a system.

	  Why do certain synchronization problems occur? What exactly
	  happens to an application when a packet is received for it?
	  Overall, where do all the applications that I use pass their
	  time? Where are the I/O latencies in a given application? etc.
