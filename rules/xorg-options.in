#config XORG_NO_PREFERENCE

#config XORG_SMALL_TERMINAL
#	bool
#	prompt "A tiny terminal X"
#	help
#	  Select this if you want an X environment for small terminals only.
#	  This server type does only the presentation of data, the clients are
#	  running on other machines.
#	  It does not support 3D features, and if the X extensions are enabled
#	  there is no need for any local font rendering, nor for local fonts.
#
#config XORG_FULL_BLOWN
#	bool
#	prompt "A full blown X"
#	help
#	  Select this type if you want to run a full blown X server on a
#	  powerful target. For this type of target the X server and the X
#	  clients are running on the same machine. This type supports 3D
#	  features, but needs all the nice libraries to fontrendering, TTF
#	  support, fonts et all.

config XORG_KEYBOARD_MAPPING_SUPPORT
	bool
	prompt "support keyboard mappings"
	select XORG_DRIVER_INPUT_KEYBOARD
	select XORG_APP_XKBCOMP
	help
	  If you like to use a keyboard with your X server (mostly wanted)
	  enable this entry. Its required when you want to configure specific
	  keyboard layouts and key settings. Mostly needed on non-US keyboards.
	  Note: A german keyboard does not support the '@¤\[]{}|' keys when
	  disabled!

config XORG_DEFAULT_DATA_DIR
	string
	prompt "default location for x' data files"
	default "/usr/lib"
	help
	  Define here the default path, where X searches for its data files
	  (fonts, configurations, keyboard mappings, etc.). X adds an "X11"
	  postfix to this path. So /usr/lib as a default path will result in
	  /usr/lib/X11 with additional subdirectories for all the data files.

config XORG_OPTIONS_TRANS_UNIX
	bool
	prompt "unix domain socket transport"
	depends on XORG_LIB_X11
	default y
	help
	  UNIX domain socket transport. You will need this feature if your
	  X server and all X clients are running on the same host.

config XORG_OPTIONS_TRANS_TCP
	bool
	prompt "tcp socket transport"
	depends on XORG_LIB_X11
	default y
	help
	 TCP socket transport. You will need this feature if your X server
	 runs on one host and at least one X client on another host.
