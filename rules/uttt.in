	  Tic tac toe can be played on any size square board from 3x3 up to 7x7.
	  On any size board, filling an entire row, column, or diagonal wins the
	  game. With 5x5 and larger boards, a point system is used to determine
	  the winner if neither player fills an entire line. One point is given
	  for each line of 4 of a player's pieces.

config UTTT_CONNECT4

	prompt "Install connect4"
	help
	  Connect 4 is played on a 7x6 board. As in the original board game,
	  pieces are placed at the top of a column, and "fall" to the bottom of
	  the column. The game is won by having 4 pieces in a line (horizontal,
	  vertical, or diagonal).
