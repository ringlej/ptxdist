	  Xev creates a window and then asks the X server to send it events
	  whenever anything happens to the window (such as it being moved,
	  resized, typed in, clicked in, etc.). You can also attach it to
	  an existing window. It is useful for seeing what causes events to
	  occur and to display the information that they contain; it is
	  essentially a debugging and development tool, and should not be
	  needed in normal usage.
