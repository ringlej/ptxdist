	  Lua is a powerful, fast, light-weight, embeddable scripting language.
	  Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description
	  constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is
	  dynamically typed, runs by interpreting bytecode for a register-based
	  virtual machine, and has automatic memory management with incremental
	  garbage collection, making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and
	  rapid prototyping.

	  lua is the stand-alone Lua interpreter.  It loads and executes
	  Lua programs, either in textual source form or in precompiled
	  binary form.  (Precompiled binaries are output by luac, the Lua
	  compiler.)  lua can be used as a batch interpreter and also
	  interactively.

	select LUA_INSTALL_LIBLUA
	help
	  luac is the Lua compiler.  It translates programs written in
	  the Lua programming language into binary files that can be
	  later loaded and executed.

	help
	  liblua.so is a shared library that can be used to embedded lua
	  scripting in C programs.
