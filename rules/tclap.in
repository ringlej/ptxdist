	  Templatized C++ Command Line Parser Library

	  TCLAP is a small, flexible library that provides a simple interface
	  for defining and accessing command line arguments. It was initially
	  inspired by the user friendly CLAP library. The difference is that
	  this library is templatized, so the argument class is type
	  independent. Type independence avoids identical-except-for-type
	  objects, such as IntArg, FloatArg, and StringArg. While the library
	  is not strictly compliant with the GNU or POSIX standards, it is
	  close.

	  NOTE: TCLAP is header-only, so the package doesn't install anything
	  on the target!
