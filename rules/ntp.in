config NTP_CLOCKCTL
	bool
	prompt "Use /dev/clockctl for non-root time control"
	help
	  The clockctl device introduces alternative entry
	  points to these system calls, through a special
	  device file typically named /dev/clockctl
	  The access control is made upon this file: if a
	  user can write to it, then the user is allowed to
	  change system time. The goal is to enable daemons
	  such as ntpd to run in a chroot jail and hence to
	  enhance the security of the system.
