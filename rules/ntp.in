config NTP_CLOCKCTL
	bool
	prompt "Use /dev/clockctl for non-root time control"
	help
	  The clockctl device introduces alternative entry
	  points to these system calls, through a special
	  device file typically named /dev/clockctl
	  The access control is made upon this file: if a
	  user can write to it, then the user is allowed to
	  change system time. The goal is to enable daemons
	  such as ntpd to run in a chroot jail and hence to
	  enhance the security of the system.

config NTP_DEBUGGING
	bool
	prompt "include debugging code"
	help
	  Include a lot of debugging code.

config NTP_DST_MINUTES
	int
	prompt "minutes per DST adjustment"
	default 60
	help
	  Enter here how many minutes should be added when
	  switching to daylight saving time.

config NTP_KMEM
	bool
	prompt "read /dev/kmem for tick and/or tickadj"
	help
	  This feature seems only required on non Linux based systems

config NTP_ACCURATE_ADJTIME
	bool
	prompt "the adjtime () call is accurate"
	help
	  The adjtime() call is accurate.

config NTP_SLEW_ALWAYS
	bool
	prompt "always slew the time"
	help
	  Slew the clock back into line by making gradual adjustments to the
	  clock over a couple of minutes.
	  (The slew rate of typical Unix kernels is limited to 0.5 ms/s.)

config NTP_STEP_SLEW
	bool
	prompt "step and slew the time"
	help
	  Slew the clock back into line by making step adjustments to the
	  clock over a couple of minutes.

	prompt "ntpdate should step the time"
	help
	  FIXME: This item needs to be documented

config NTP_HOURLY_TODR_SYNC
	bool
	prompt "sync TODR hourly"
	help
	  If we should sync TODR hourly (the Solaris hardware clock).
	  When unsure, say no here.

config NTP_KERNEL_FLL_BUG
	bool
	prompt "avoid a kernel FLL bug"
	help
	  If we should avoid a (Solaris) kernel FLL bug.

config NTP_IRIG_SAWTOOTH
	bool
	prompt "enable the IRIG sawtooth filter"
	help
	  The Sun kernel driver has a sawtooth modulation with
	  amplitude over 5 ms peak-peak and period 5.5 s. The crafty
	  IRIG driver uses a transverse filter to remove the
	  modulation and something called a botttom-fisher to remove
	  incidental positive spikes especially prevalent with Sun
	  Blade 1000 and possibly other systems.

config NTP_NIST
	bool
	prompt "enable the NIST lockclock scheme"
	help
	  The NIST lockclock program synchronizes the local clock
	  via a telephone modem and the NIST Automated Computer
	  Time Service (ACTS), or the Digital Time Synchronization
	  Service (DTSS), which runs on DCE machines.

config NTP_CRYPTO
	bool
	prompt "use openssl"
	help
	  FIXME: This item needs to be documented

config NTP_SNTP
	bool
	prompt "build SNTP"
	help
	  Simple Network Time Protocol is a subset of the Network
	  Time Protocol (NTP). SNTP can be used when the ultimate
	  performance of a full NTP implementation based on
	  RFC 1305 is neither needed nor justified.
	  It is strongly recommended that SNTP be used only at
	  the extremities of the synchronization subnet.

config NTP_ARLIB

	help
	  FIXME: This item needs to be documented

comment "Clock drivers"

config NTP_ALL_CLOCK_DRIVERS
	bool

	default y
	help
	  Disabling this entry will only build a set of selected clock drivers.
	  Else all clock drivers are included into the ntpd.
