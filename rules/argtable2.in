	 Argtable is an ANSI C library for parsing GNU style command line
	 arguments with a minimum of fuss. It enables the programmer to define
	 their program's argument syntax directly in the source code as an
	 array of structs. The command line is then parsed according to that
	 specification and the resulting values stored directly into
	 user-defined program variables where they are accessible to the main
	 program.
