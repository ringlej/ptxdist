	  Xerces-C++ is a validating XML parser written in a portable
	  subset of C++. Xerces-C++ makes it easy to give your
	  application the ability to read and write XML data. A shared
	  library is provided for parsing, generating, manipulating, and
	  validating XML documents.

	  See http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/ for details.
