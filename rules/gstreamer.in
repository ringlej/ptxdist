	  GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of
	  filters which operate on media data. Applications using this
	  library can do anything from real-time sound processing to
	  playing videos, and just about anything else
	  media-related. Its plugin-based architecture means that new
	  data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by
	  installing new plug-ins.
