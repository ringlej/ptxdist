	  ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine and
	  for executing commands on a remote machine. It provides secure
	  encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts over an insecure
	  network.  X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP ports can also be
	  forwarded over the secure channel. It is intended as a replacement
	  for rlogin, rsh and rcp, and can be used to provide applications with
	  a secure communication channel.
