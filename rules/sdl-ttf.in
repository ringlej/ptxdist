	  SDL_ttf is a TrueType font rendering library that is used with the
	  SDL library, and almost as portable. It depends on freetype2 to
	  handle the TrueType font data. It allows a programmer to use
	  multiple TrueType fonts without having to code a font rendering
	  routine themselves. With the power of outline fonts and
	  antialiasing, high quality text output can be obtained without much
	  effort.
