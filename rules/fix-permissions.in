config FIX_PERMISSIONS
	bool
	prompt "create primary rootfs devnodes for nfs and fix permissions"
	help
	  This function is useful for development via nfsroot. Initially, the
	  /dev/null and /dev/console devnodes are missing in a fresh sysroot for
	  nfs, preventing a successful system startup. However, creating them
	  requires system administrator privileges.

	  Say Yes, if you want PTXdist to create missing devnodes during build
	  stage. This will result in a smooth nfsroot feeling, but you need to
	  setup sudo first.
