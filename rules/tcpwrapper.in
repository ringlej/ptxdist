	  With this package you can monitor and filter incoming requests for the
	  SYSTAT, FINGER, FTP, TELNET, RLOGIN, RSH, EXEC, TFTP, TALK, and other
	  network services.

	  The package provides tiny daemon wrapper programs that can be installed
	  without any changes to existing software or to existing configuration
	  files.  The wrappers report the name of the client host and of the
	  requested service; the wrappers do not exchange information with the
	  client or server applications, and impose no overhead on the actual
	  conversation between the client and server applications.

	  The tcpd program can be set up to monitor incoming requests for telnet,
	  finger, ftp, exec, rsh, rlogin, tftp, talk, comsat and other services
	  that have a one-to-one mapping onto executable files.

	help
