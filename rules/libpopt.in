	  lib for parsing cmdline parameters

	  Popt was heavily influenced by the getopt() and
	  getopt_long() functions, but it allows more powerful
	  argument expansion. It can parse arbitrary argv[] style
	  arrays and automatically set variables based on command line
	  arguments. It also allows command line arguments to be
	  aliased via configuration files and includes utility
	  functions for parsing arbitrary strings into argv[] arrays
	  using shell-like rules.
