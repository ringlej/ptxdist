	  MPEG audio player in fixed point

	  MAD is an MPEG audio decoder. It currently only supports the
	  MPEG 1 standard, but fully implements all three audio layers
	  (Layer I, Layer II, and Layer III, the latter often
	  colloquially known as MP3.).  There is also full support for
	  ID3 tags.

	  All work is done in fixed point, so it even works on
	  machines without an FPU.
