	  mmpong is an ATARI-pong-like multiplayer game, where a
	  moving ball reflects on impact from paddles on the left and
	  right sides of the screen.  A special feature of this
	  variant is the ability to play the game with far more than
	  two players. Players are split into two teams, and the
	  position of each team's paddle is determined by the mean
	  value of the positions of all the players' paddles on the
	  team. mmpong supports a number of different paddle profiles
	  (like flat or round).
