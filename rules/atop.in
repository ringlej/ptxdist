	  Monitor for system resources and process activity

	  Atop is an ASCII full-screen performance monitor that is capable of
	  reporting the activity of all processes (even if processes have
	  finished during the interval), daily logging of system and process
	  activity for long-term analysis, highlighting overloaded system
	  resources by using colors, etc. At regular intervals, it shows
	  system-level activity related to the CPU, memory, swap, disks,
	  and network layers, and for every active process it shows the
	  CPU utilization, the memory growth, priority, username, state,
	  and exit code.
