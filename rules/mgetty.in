	help
	  mgetty+sendfax is a reliable and proven fax send and receive solution.

	  mgetty is a modem-aware getty. It supports modems with the Hayes AT
	  command set and is especially designed for supporting modems that
	  are used to send faxes and to dial out as well as dial in. These
	  features are not required for a serial console.

	  Sendfax is designed to be able to send exactly one fax (consisting
	  of multiple pages) to exactly one fax machine, but it is usable from
	  within shell scripts. Its input are pages in "g3" format, either
	  created with ghostscript or with pbm2g3.
