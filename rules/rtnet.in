	  RTnet is an Open Soure hard real-time network protocol
	  stack for Xenomai and RTAI (real-time Linux extensions).
	  It makes use of standard Ethernet hardware and supports
	  several popular NIC chip sets, including Gigabit Ethernet.
	  Moreover, Ethernet-over-1394 support is available based
	  on the RT-FireWire protocol stack.

		This driver is probably not real-time safe! Under certain conditions
		it can cause interrupt locks of up to 1 second (issue_and_wait). We
		need a rewrite of critical parts, but we are lacking the knowledge
		about the hardware details (e.g. how long does a normal delay take =>
		apply this value and throw an error message on timeouts).
