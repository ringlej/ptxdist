	  GNU wget is a commandline mirroring tool.

	  It is a network utility to retrieve files from the
	  Web using http and ftp, the two most widely used
	  Internet protocols. It works non-interactively,
	  so it will work in the background, after having
	  logged off. The program supports recursive retrieval
	  of web-authoring pages as well as ftp sites -- you
	  can use wget to make mirrors of archives and
 	  home pages or to travel the Web like a WWW robot.

 	  Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable
	  connections by continuing to retrieve a document
	  until the document is fully downloaded. Re-getting
	  files from where it left off works on servers
	  (both http and ftp) that support it.

	  Both http and ftp retrievals can be time stamped,
	  so wget can see if the remote file has changed
	  since the last retrieval and automatically retrieve
	  the new version if it has.

	  Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the
	  network load, speed up retrieval, and provide
	  access behind firewalls.
