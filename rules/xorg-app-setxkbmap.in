	  This tool is needed to load new keyboard mappings into a running
	  X server. It can be run locally or remotly. If you are going to build
	  a tiny terminal X server only, there is *no* need for this tool on the
	  target. In this case only xkbcomp is required if you have trouble to
	  configure a special keyboard mapping.
	  For a full blown X server setxkbmap can be useful, but is not
	  required for keyboard setup. It can be done by xorg.conf configuration
	  and xkbcomp only at X server's startup.
