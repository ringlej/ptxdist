	  This is the Trick Or Treat Daemon (TOTD)

	  Totd is a DNS proxy for IPv4/IPv6 translation,
	  developed by the Vermicelli Project (Norway)
	  and can be used as a DNS-ALG for NAT-PT or
	  pTRTd based setups.

	  Beware: This is rather old vodoo, last upstream update was
	  in 2005. This ptxdist package ist provided primarily for
	  test environments, ipv6 transition planing, etc.

	  The Debian Project has a slightly older version of this
	  package at http://packages.qa.debian.org/t/totd.html with
	  some patches (resolvconf integration, l10n, etc)
