	  CRDA acts as the udev helper for communication between the kernel and
	  userspace for regulatory compliance. It relies on nl80211 for communication.
	  CRDA is intended to be run only through udev communication from the kernel.
	  The user should never have to run it manually except if debugging udev issues.
