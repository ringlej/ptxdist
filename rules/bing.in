	  Empirical stochastic bandwidth tester (bing)

	  Bing is a point-to-point bandwidth measurement
	  tool (hence the 'b'), based on ping.

 	  Bing determines the real (raw, as opposed to
	  available or average) throughput on a link by
	  measuring ICMP echo requests' round trip times
 	  for different packet sizes at each end of the
	  link.
