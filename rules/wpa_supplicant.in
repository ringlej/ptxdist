	help
	  This option enables or disables installation of the wpa_cli tool in
	  the root file system. The tool allows controlling wpa_supplicant
	  if used in daemon mode.

	  You need something like

	      ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=network
	      update_config=1

	  in your /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf to make wpa_cli working. Often
	  it's not necessary to have wpa_cli in the final (non-development)
	  version of an Embedded System.
