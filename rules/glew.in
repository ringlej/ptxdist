	  The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (GLEW) is a cross-platform
	  open-source C/C++ extension loading library. GLEW provides
	  efficient run-time mechanisms for determining which OpenGL
	  extensions are supported on the target platform. OpenGL core
	  and extension functionality is exposed in a single header file.
	  GLEW has been tested on a variety of operating systems,
	  including Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, Irix, and Solaris.
