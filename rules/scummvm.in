	  ScummVM is a program which allows you to run certain classic
	  graphical point-and-click adventure games, provided you already have
	  their data files. The clever part about this: ScummVM just replaces
	  the executables shipped with the games, allowing you to play them on
	  systems for which they were never designed!
