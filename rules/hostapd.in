	  IEEE 802.11 AP and IEEE 802.1X/WPA/WPA2/EAP Authenticator

	  Originally, hostapd was an optional user space component for
	  Host AP driver. It adds more features to the basic IEEE
	  802.11 management included in the kernel driver: using
	  external RADIUS authentication server for MAC address based
	  access control, IEEE 802.1X Authenticator and dynamic WEP
	  keying, RADIUS accounting, WPA/WPA2 (IEEE 802.11i/RSN)
	  Authenticator and dynamic TKIP/CCMP keying.

	  The current version includes support for other drivers, an
	  integrated EAP authenticator (i.e., allow full
	  authentication without requiring an external RADIUS
	  authentication server), and RADIUS authentication server for
	  EAP authentication.
