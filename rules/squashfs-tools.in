	  Squashfs is a highly compressed read-only filesystem for Linux.
	  It uses zlib compression to compress both files, inodes and directories.
	  Inodes in the system are very small and all blocks are packed to minimise
	  data overhead. Block sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum
	  of 1Mbytes (default block size 128K).
