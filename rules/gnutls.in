	  GnuTLS is a secure communications library implementing the SSL,
	  TLS and DTLS protocols and technologies around them.
	  It provides a simple C language application programming interface
	  (API) to access the secure communications protocols as well as
	  APIs to parse and write X.509, PKCS #12, OpenPGP and other required
	  structures. It is aimed to be portable and efficient with focus on
	  security and interoperability.
