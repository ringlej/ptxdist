	  Fontconfig is a font configuration and
	  customization library, which does not depend on
	  the X Window System.  It is designed to locate
	  fonts within the system and select them according
	  to requirements specified by applications.

	  Fontconfig is not a rasterization library, nor
	  does it impose a particular rasterization library
	  on the application.  The X-specific library 'Xft'
	  uses fontconfig along with freetype to specify and
	  rasterize fonts.

	  The fontconfig utilities package contains fc-list,
	  fc-match, and fc-cache.
	  fc-list lists fonts and styles available on the system
	    for applications using fontconfig.
	  fc-match  matches fontpattern (empty pattern by
	    default) using the normal fontconfig matching rules to
	    find the best font available.
	  fc-cache  scans the font directories on the system and
	    builds font information cache files for applications
	    using fontconfig for their font handling.
