config LIBMATTHEW_JAVA_IO
	bool
	prompt "IO extension"
	help
	  This provides a few much needed extensions to the Java I/O
	  subsystem. Firstly, there is a class which will connect and
	  InputStream with an OutputStream and copy data between them.

	  Secondly there are two classes for inserting into an Input or
	  OutputStream pipe a command line command, so that everything is
	  piped through that command.

	  Thirdly there are a pair of classes for splitting streams in two.
	  This can either be to two OuputStreams, or to an OutputStream and a
	  file. Equivelent to the UNIX tool tee in UNIX pipes.

config LIBMATTHEW_JAVA_HEXDUMP
	bool
	prompt "Hexdump support"
	help
	  This class formats byte-arrays in hex and ascii for display.
