	  fast compression program

	  lzop is a compressor similar to gzip. Its main advantages
	  over gzip are much higher compression and decompression
	  speed. lzop was designed with the following goals in mind:

	  1) reliability
	  2) speed (both compression and decompression)
	  3) reasonable drop-in compatibility with gzip
	  4) portability
