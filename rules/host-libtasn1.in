	  Manage ASN1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) structures. The
	  main features of this library are:
	  * on-line ASN1 structure management that doesn't require any
            C code file generation.
	  * off-line ASN1 structure management with C code file
            generation containing an array.
	  * DER (Distinguish Encoding Rules) encoding
	  * no limits for INTEGER and ENUMERATED values
