	  versatile, virtual-hosting FTP daemon

	  ProFTPd is a powerful replacement for wu-ftpd. This File
	  Transfer Protocol daemon supports hidden directories,
	  virtual hosts, and per-directory ".ftpaccess" files. It uses
	  a single main configuration file, with a syntax similar to
	  Apache.

	  Because of the advanced design, anonymous-FTP directories
	  can have an arbitrary internal structure (bin, lib, etc, and
	  special files are not needed). Advanced features such as
	  multiple password files and upload/download ratios are also
	  supported.

config PROFTPD_PAM
	bool
	prompt "PAM support"
	depends on BROKEN
	help
	  PAM, which stands for Pluggable Authentication Modules,
	  is an API intended to make it easy to replace the old
	  Unix-style DES password hashes with a flexible system that
	  allows to use MD5 checksums, SQL tables, LDAP servers, RADIUS
	  servers, etc in place of that password check.
	  However, what PAM does not provide is the rest of the user
	  account information in /etc/passwd, i.e. the user's UID and
	  GID, home directory, and shell. This means that PAM cannot
	  be used as a drop-in replacement for user information stored
	  in /etc/passwd. NSS (Name Service Switch) modules, supported
	  by some operating systems, are a complementary API to PAM
	  which can be used to supply the rest of this user information.

	  proftpd uses the normal libc functions for looking up user
	  information, and those libc functions typically read
	  /etc/passwd. NSS is an abstraction layer within some libc
	  implementations that causes those functions to read other
	  sources rather than /etc/passwd.

config PROFTPD_SENDFILE
	bool
	prompt "sendfile support"
	help
	  Unix kernels handle a socket as just another file descriptor;
	  this means that sendfile(2) can be used to efficiently copy
	  data from a file on disk to a network socket, e.g. for
	  downloading a file.

	  As useful as the sendfile(2) function can be, there are
	  unfortunately cases where bad implementations of the function
	  can cause problems. These problems manifest as broken or
	  aborted downloads, or as downloaded data being corrupted, or
	  even as downloaded files being larger than the original file.

config PROFTPD_SHADOW
	bool
	prompt "shadow support"
	default y
	help
	  Some operating systems require you to use either
	  --enable-autoshadow or --enable-shadow if you wish to use
	  the system's shadow password file for user authentication.

config PROFTPD_AUTOSHADOW
	bool
	prompt "autoshadow support"
	depends on PROFTPD_SHADOW
	default y
	help
	  Using autoshadow allows proftpd to work with either shadow
	  or traditional password files.
