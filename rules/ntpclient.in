	  ntpclient is a small and efficient client to the NTP protocol.

	  Description by Larry Doolittle:
	  ntpclient is an NTP (RFC-1305) client for unix-alike computers.
       	  Its functionality is a small subset of xntpd, but IMHO performs
	  better (or at least has the potential to function better) within
	  that limited scope. Since it is much smaller than xntpd, it is
	  also more relevant for embedded computers.
