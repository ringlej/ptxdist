	  ext2 filesystem generator for embedded systems
 	  `genext2fs' is meant to generate an ext2 filesystem
 	  as a normal (non-root) user. It doesn't require you
	  to mount the image file to copy files on it. It
	  doesn't even require you to be the superuser to
	  make device nodes.

 	  Warning! 'genext2fs' has been designed for embedded
 	  systems. As such, it will generate a filesystem for
	  single-user usage: all files/directories/etc.
	  will belong to UID/GID 0.
