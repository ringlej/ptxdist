	  XZ-format compression utilities

	  XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
	  compression format, which provides memory-hungry but
	  powerful compression (often better than bzip2) and fast,
	  easy decompression.

	  This package provides the command line tools for working
	  with XZ compression, including xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and
	  so on. They can also handle the older LZMA format, and if
	  invoked via appropriate symlinks will emulate the behavior
	  of the commands in the lzma package.

	  The XZ format is similar to the older LZMA format but
	  includes some improvements for general use:

	  * 'file' magic for detecting XZ files;
	  * crc64 data integrity check;
	  * limited random-access reading support;
	  * improved support for multithreading (not used in xz-utils);
	  * support for flushing the encoder.
