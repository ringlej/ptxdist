	help
	  lsh-keygen - Generates a keypair and write it on stdout.
	  Generates a new private key for the desired algorithm
	  and security level and write it on stdout.

	  You will usually want to pipe the new key into a program
	  like lsh-writekey, to split it into its private and public
	  parts, and optionally encrypt the private information.

config LSH_WRITEKEY
	bool
	prompt "Install lsh-writekey"
	help
	  lsh-writekey - Keypair split/store handler.
	  Splits a keypair in one private and one public file,
	  optionally encrypting the private file using a passphrase.

	  Common usage is to pipe the output from lsh-keygen into
	  this program.
