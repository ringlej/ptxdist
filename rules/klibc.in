	prompt "klibc                         "
	help
	  This feature contains a collection of programs that are
	  linked against klibc. These duplicate some of the
	  functionality of a regular Linux toolset, but are typically
	  much smaller than their full-function counterparts. They are
	  intended for inclusion in initramfs images and can do the
	  network configuration outside the kernel and someting
	  special before mounting the final root filesystem.

choice
	prompt "link klibc programs"
	help
	  You can select how to link the klibc programs.

	  There are two possibilities, either links shared or
	  static. When linking statically the klibc is linked into
	  each program. Select this if you only have a few
	  programs. On the other hand if you have many tools a
	  dynamically linked klibc saves some space.

	default "/kinit"
	help
	  A kernel will always start /init in the initramfs if not
	  otherwise specified (see kernel parameter "init="). With
	  this link ist possible to start any program you like.

config KLIBC_USER_SPEC
	bool
	prompt "parse project specific initramfs_spec"
	help
	  parse the spec file which is expected to live in
	  ${PTXDIST_WORKSPACE}/initramfs_spec. The format is the same
	  as described in the kernelsource under

	  Documentation/early-userspace/README.

	  Files described in this file can either have an absolute or
	  a relative path (relative to ${PTXDIST_WORKSPACE}).
