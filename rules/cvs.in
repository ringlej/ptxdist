	prompt "Populate CVSROOT files"
	help
	  This will install a list of files into target's cvs repository. These files
	  are supporting files; they do not have to exist for cvs to operate, but they
	  allow you to make cvs operation more flexible.
	  Here is the list of files cvs can run on some events:
	  - commitinfo
	  - cvsignore
	  - cvswrappers
	  - editinfo
	  - history
	  - loginfo
	  - modules
	  - rcsinfo
	  - taginfo
	  and for general configuration:
	  - config
	  - passwd
	  - readers
	  - writers
	  PTXdist will copy these files from the active project from projectroot/cvsroot/
	  into target's file system. Only existing files in projectroot/cvsroot/ will be
	  copied to /srv/cvsroot/CVSROOT/ (or anywhere you locate the repository). To use
	  this feature do not leave "cvs' repository" entry empty!

		  Install a inetd rule for cvs. This option adds the following line
		  to /etc/inetd.conf.d/cvs:

		  Note: You must enable one of the two possible inet daemons:
		  There is one embedded in busybox and one in packet inetutils.
