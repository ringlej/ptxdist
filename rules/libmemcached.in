	  libmemcached is a C client library for interfacing to a memcached
	  server. It has been designed to be light on memory usage, thread
	  safe and to provide full access to server side methods. It also
	  implements several command line tools: memcat, memflush, memrm,
	  memstat, and memslap (for load generation). The library has been
	  designed to allow for different hashing methods on keys,
	  partitioning by keys, and to use consistent hashing for 
	  distribution.
