	  Programs to send and receive fax messages

 	  efax is a small ANSI C/POSIX program that provides
	  the data transport function for fax applications
	  using any Class 1 or Class 2 fax modem.

 	  Another program, efix, converts between fax, text,
	  bit-map and gray-scale formats. fax, a shell script,
	  provides a simple user interface to the efax and efix
	  programs. It allows you to send text or Postscript
	  files as faxes and receive, print or preview
	  received faxes.
