	  The stunnel program is designed to work as an SSL encryption
	  wrapper between remote client and local (inetd-startable) or
	  remote servers. The goal is to facilitate SSL encryption and
	  authentication for non-SSL-aware programs.

	  stunnel can be used to add  SSL  functionality  to  commonly
	  used  inetd  daemons  like  POP-2,  POP-3  and  IMAP servers
	  without any changes in the programs' code.
