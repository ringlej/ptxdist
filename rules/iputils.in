	  ping uses the ICMP protocols mandatory ECHO_REQUEST datagram to elicit
	  an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from a host or gateway.
	  It works with both IPv4 and IPv6. Using only one of them explicitly can
	  be enforced by specifying -4 or -6.

	  tracepath traces the path to a network host discovering the MTU along
	  this path. Because it uses UDP for tracing, it does not need superuser

	  way to a given host. Supports UDP, ICMP and TCP for tracing and works
	  for IPv6 only.
