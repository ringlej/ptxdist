config UDEV_UDEV
	bool "udev"
	depends on UDEV
	help
	  udev provides a dynamic device directory containing only
	  the files for actually present devices. It creates or
	  removes device node files in the /dev directory, or it
	  renames network interfaces.

	  Usually udev runs as udevd(8) and receives uevents directly
	  from the kernel if a device is added or removed form the system.

	  If udev receives a device event, it matches its configured
	  rules against the available device attributes provided in
	  sysfs to identify the device. Rules that match, may provide
	  additional device information or specify a device node name
	  and multiple symlink names and instruct udev to run
	  additional programs as part of the device event handling.

config UDEV_UDEVD
	bool "udevd"
	depends on UDEV
	help
	  udevd listens to kernel uevents and passes the incoming
	  events to udev. It ensures the right event order and
	  takes care, that events for child devices are delayed
	  until the parent has finished the device handling.

config UDEV_INFO
	bool "udevinfo"
	depends on UDEV
	help
	  udevinfo queries the udev database for device
	  information stored in the udev database. It
	  can also query the properties of a device from
	  its sysfs representation to help creating udev
	  rules that match this device.

config UDEV_SEND
	bool "udevsend"
	depends on UDEV
	help
	  This is the command the kernel calls if a hotplug event
	  occures (see /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug) to trigger the udev
	  subsystem. Its only required for older kernels to achieve
	  their hotplug mechanism.

config UDEV_TEST
	bool "udevtest"
	depends on UDEV
	help
	  udevtest simulates a udev run for the given device
	  and prints out the name of the node udev would have
	  created, or the name of the network interface, that
	  would have been renamend.
