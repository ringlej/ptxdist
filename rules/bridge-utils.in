	  Utilities for configuring the Linux ethernet bridge

	  This package contains utilities for configuring the
	  Linux ethernet bridge.

	  The Linux ethernet bridge can be used to tie multiple
	  ethernet devices together. The connection is fully
	  transparent: hosts connected to one ethernet device
	  can see all hosts connected to any of the other
	  ethernet devices directly.
