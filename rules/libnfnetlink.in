          libnfnetlink is the low-level library for netfilter
          related kernel/userspace communication. It provides a generic
          messaging infrastructure for in-kernel netfilter subsystems
          (such as nfnetlink_log) and their respective users and/or
          management tools in userspace.
          This library is not meant as a public API for application
          developers. It is only used by other netfilter.org projects,
          such as libnetfilter_log,
