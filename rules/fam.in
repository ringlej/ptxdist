	  FAM (File Alteration Monitor) is a server which tracks changes to the
	  filesystem and relays these changes to interested applications. Its
	  efficiency comes from consolidating the polling for all applications
	  or, with kernel support, from obtaining kernel notifications of file
	  system changes. This also works for network filesystems, if the remote
	  host also runs a fam daemon.

	  This version is patched so it uses the kernel's DNOTIFY feature. Ensure this
	  feature is enabled in the kernel (search for symbol CONFIG_DNOTIFY)

	  This daemon requires portmap to spread its service.

		  Install a inetd rule for famd. This option adds the following line
		  to /etc/inetd.conf.d/fam:

		  sgi_fam/1-2 stream  rpc/tcp wait root /usr/sbin/famd famd -c /etc/fam.conf

		  Note: You must enable one of the two possible inet daemons: There is
		  one embedded in busybox and one in packet inetutils.

		  This installs a startup script into /etc/init.d/portmapd. With
