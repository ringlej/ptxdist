	the use of:
	 - a specific toolchain vendor (name)
	 - a specific toolchain (prefix name)

	  to the fact that host side ipkg is now mandatory we always

	  for things already mentioned in the todo list

	  Patch by Marc Kleine-Budde.

	* initng: initial support for initng; patch by Erwin Rol
	* udhcp: fixed; patch by Erwin Rol

	* ptxdist: native build works now with --native
	* ptxdist: autobuild reanimated
	* config/: obsolete stuff removed

	  directory as the crosstool components.

	* ptxdist clone: fixed; thanks to Erwin Rol for the bug report

2006-03-11 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* autobuild: The statistics functions have been moved to
	  ptxdist, so the autobuild scripts do only contain the
	  call to the build process now.

	* ptxdistrc: $HOME/.ptxdistrc is now versioned, to avoid that
	  people use old and incompatible ones.

	* ptxdistrc: We have a user configurable src directory again,
	  in .ptxdistrc.${FULLVERSION}.

	* projects: separated toolchains and example projects.

2006-03-10 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* ptxdist: integrated autobuilder in ptxdist

	* toolchains: fixed chicken-egg-problem while building
	  toolchains

	* ipkg: fixed ipkg build mechanism and image creation.

2006-03-09 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* release: released 0.10.0.

	There are too many features added & cleaned up in the 0.10.0
	release than could be mentioned here. This release is basically
	the last step before an 1.0 series; all functionality has been
	moved to the 'ptxdist' frontend command now, so there is no need
	to call 'make' directly any more.

	PTXdist can now be installed, which means that the standard
	configure && make && make install mechanics works, although the
	configure script is no "real" autoconf script yet. We plan to
	provide one. Several PTXdist versions can be installed in
	parallel now and it should be packageble for distributions.

	One serious bug in the release was already found, the toolchains
	test for the crosscompiler version (chicken-and-egg). Expect a
	0.10.1 release anytime soon, probably before you read this ;)

	All project work is now done in a user- and project centric way.
	You work on your project's "workspace" directory (equivalent to
	the out-of-tree directory in 0.9).

	Packet management has been much more streamlined. You always
	need a .make _and_ .in file for each packet and packet names
	must have a strong relation to their kconfig labels, like this:

		project-foo -> PROJECT_FOO

	All "included" projects have been migrated to the new formats,
	but not all of them have been tested extensively. Expect more
	releases in the near future which restore the old auditing
	mechanisms.

2006-02-03 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* trunk: opened 0.10 trunk.

	The even/odd version number scheme turned out to be too unflexible; it
	is impossible to tell people that, once they have reached a stable
	state, they still have to switch to a new version line. So the new
	policy is that the latest minor version number is the current
	development series (0.10 from now on) and all earlier series are in bug
	fix mode only. Nevertheless, there may be occasional releases of these
	series when the projects require it.

	The autogenerated dependencies introduced in 0.9 have turned out to be
	working fairly well, it's just a little bit annoying that the creation
	is triggered too often and takes too much time on slow machines. So
	the main goal for the 0.10 series is to write a PTXdist wrapper script
	which does what you did with 'make <action>' before, like
	'ptxdist <action'.  This gives us more possibilities (think of
	'ptxdist copy <existing_project> <new_project>') without adding more
	ifdef hell to the toplevel makefile. In fact, one of the reasons for
	doing this is to cleanup the toplevel makefile which has growin
	into a shell script triggering machine over the time. Additionally, the
	projectdir layout will improve over the 0.10 series, to make it
	easier to do real customer project work with PTXdist.

2006-01-31 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* genext2fs: update to 1.4rc1 which doesn't need the patches any
	  more (patch by Randall Loomis)
	* openssh: fix autogenerated dependency (patch by Ladislav
	  Michl)
	* release: 0.9.1 released

2006-01-30 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* mico: added support for MICO.

2006-01-26 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* overall: this is a technology preview of the upcoming 0.9
	  series of PTXdist. Not everything is working right now,
	  but we have autogenerated dependencies.

2006-01-03 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* overall: merged destdir branch into 0.9-trunk
	  kernel: replaced DONT_COMPILE_KERNEL by
	  COMPILE_KERNEL

2005-12-28 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* trunk: migrated destdir branch to new 0.9 trunk
	  The tree is now using destdir/sysroot as it's standard
	  mechanism. It doesn't work in all places, but it's the
	  way to go for the future.

2005-12-20 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* Rules: remove some bogus mkdir $(IMAGEDIR)s;
	  Patch by Ladislav Michl

	* bash: fixed PATH; patch by Vince Chen

2005-12-14 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* release: released 0.7.8. This is just an intermediate
	  release. We are working hard towards 1.0, so expect
	  things to be completely broken. You have been warned.

2005-11-30 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* overall: re-unified TOPDIR and PTXDISTDIR to become
	  PTXDIST_DIR now.
	* makefiles: out-of-tree builds should work now; just
	  make an empty directory, link the PTXdist toplevel
	  Makefile there and do everything you want. This feature
	  probably needs more testing, but it's a beginning.
	* kconfig/lxdialog: migrated to be hosttools, but still
	  with the strange effect that they need to be in
	  scripts/* seen from the Makefile.

2005-11-18 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* ntpclient: targetinstall fixed; patch by Steven Scholz

2005-11-14 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

2005-11-01 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

2005-10-21 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

2005-10-08 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* rtai: removed rtai in kernel config, could now be done with
	  the patch stack mechanism (in case anybody would be
	  interested)

	  to actually build something on targetinstall.
	* dhcp: update from 3.0.1 to 3.0.3; patch by Ulf Samuelsson
	* sysvinit: patch by Oscar Peredo added.
	* zlib: build also static zlib; patch by Kai-Uwe Bloem
	* uclibc: install libthread_db if gdbserver is used; patch by

	  work. Patch by Kai-Uwe Bloem

2005-09-28 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* Makefile: more makefile cleanups. New policy: everything is
	  now built in a "workspace"; usually nothing changes, but if
	  you set PTXDISTWORKSPACE we build there. (UPDDATE: this is
	  PTXDIST_WORKSPACE in more recent versions)
	* paths: moved local_patches to patches; as the patch repository
	  is now in the SVN repository there's no need to copy patches

	  shall be used. The kernel can now optionally be installed on the
	  target system (e.g. for jffs partitions).

	  avoids that the complete toolchain is recompiled when you change
	  something for the kernel (like patching it with RTAI).

	  space utilities.

	* busybox: kconfig transition finished. This should work now.

	* general: 0.3.13 finalized

2003-01-11  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* busybox: busybox-0.61.pre-ptx3 added, based on CVS snapshot
	  from 2002/12/10. This version of busybox is based on kconfig,
	  so it is possible to integrate this into our config system again.

	* general: 0.3.12 finalized; this is an intermediate release; don't
	  use it for production systems.

2002-11-16  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* general: fixed everything to make it work with the new
	  configuration system

	* config system: ported to use the latest version from linux-2.5.47.
	  I assume this will be the way to go in the future, as lkc doesn't
	  seem to be supported as a separate package any more.

	* general: 0.3.11 finalized

2002-11-08  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* general: 0.3.9 finalized.


2002-10-13  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* glibc: now we install libnss_* to the target, which (surprise!) was
	the reason why proftpd didn't want to let our users login until now.

	* general: 0.3.8 finalized.

2002-10-12  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* proftpd: added to the distribution.

	* glibc: support for glibc-2.2.3 added

	* general: 0.3.7 finalized.

2002-10-07  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* lsh: key generation for target does work now.

	* glibc: option for libm installation added.

	* general: bugfixing; 0.3.6 finalized.

2002-10-04  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* ptxflash: Utility to make a self contained bootstrap;
	this is currently highly specific to the MOPSlcd4 board...

	* grub: GNU GRUB can now be installed; you can choose to
	build a bootdisk for the target system in $PTXDIST/bootdisk.

	* e2fsprog: integrated, so we have mke2fs now. Has to be
	better configurable.

	* Makefile: rootclean target re-introduced.

	* rtai: RTAI is now integrated. Needs more testing.

	* config system: version number fixed. The archive target gives a
	warning now, we should change this to a permanent fix.

	* lsh: lsh added. This requires packets for zlib, libgmp,
	liboop and nettle which have been installed.

2002-09-30  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* busybox: works now for ARM. The route applet has a bug and
	cannot be compiled, but this is an upstream problem.

	* toolchain: first release with a working toolchain! gcc stage
	two is now able to compile kernel 2.4.18, busybox 0.61-pre-ptx1
	and glibc-2.2.5.

	* general: 0.3.4 finalized.

2002-09-26  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* busybox: added a makefile for busybox, currently only for an
	unstable version from CVS. This will be changed to stable once
	Erik Andersen has made a release.

	* x86 port: backported makefiles to support compilation for a x86 based
	target system.

	* toolchain: the cross toolchain does still have major bugs
	concerning the compiled in paths.


2002-09-20  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* general: several bugs fixed which prevented the system from being
	compiled without having a toolchain right from the beginning.

	* general: 0.3.2 finalized. This is the first version which has all
	the infrastructure for making a complete cross toolchain for ARM.
