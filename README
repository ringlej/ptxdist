PTXdist
=======

Necessary Packages
------------------

In order to build ptxdist, you need three archives:

	ptxdist-<version>.tgz		(mandatory)
	ptxdist-<version>-projects.tgz	(optional)

Extract these archives into some build directory; the tarballs are put
together in a way that they extract into one subdir ptxdist-<version>.

Installation
------------

To install PTXdist, just run

	./configure --prefix=<installpath>

to configure the packet, then

	make

to build everything and

	make install

to install it. When you start using PTXdist, make sure your $PATH
environment variable points to <installpath>/bin, because that's where
the ptxdist frontend program is being installed to.

For developers who want to work with svn versions of PTXdist it is only
necessary to run "./configure && make" and set the PATH variable to the
bin/ directory inside the PTXdist tree.


Quickstart
----------

PTXdist comes with some example projects in the

	ptxdist-<version>-projects.tgz

archive. If this packet is installed with ptxdist it is possible to
"clone" the example projects and use them i.e. as a start for your own
project. Find out which projects are available, using

	$ ptxdist projects

Then clone a project with

	$ ptxdist clone <projectname> myproject

This copies the project named <projectname> into ./myproject, which is
your "workspace" for the following actions.

Change into your project's workspace and build everything:

	$ cd myproject
	$ ptxdist go

This builds a root filesystem into the root/ directory of your
workspace. If the project was built for the same architecture as your
devenlopment machine, you can try it with

	$ chroot root/ /bin/sh

If you have more time to find out how it works, read on.


Idea
----

PTXdist is a tool which can be used to generate a root tree for all
kinds of Linux systems. It was written with embedded systems in mind,
but there is no reason why you can't use it to configure your firewall,
router or whatever dedicated "device" comes to your mind.

The job works like this: you run 'ptxdist menuconfig' and
"ptxdist platformconfig", configure what you need. Run 'ptxdist go'
and you'll find a root tree in <you-platform>/root/. Voila.

All magic necessary to do these things in a cross enviroment are written
into "recipies", living in rules/*.make, and config menues in
rules/*.in.


Directory Layout
----------------

These files and directories are supposed to be in an empty project
directory:

configs/		project specific configurations (optional)
patches/		project specific patches, overwrites the generic
			ones from PTXdist
projectroot/		put files here which are to be copied over to
			the target's root directory, like for example
			etc files, scripts, ... Note that the copying
			has to be done explicitly by some project
			specific rule file.
ptxconfig		.config file to configure the userland for
			your project.
platformconfig		.config file to configure the platform specific
			part of your project.
rules/			contains project specific rules
src -> ...		link to point to your directory containing
			tarball files for the packets.

Additionally some other directories are being built when you run
"ptxdist go" or other start other build targets.

<platform>/build-host/	build directory for host tools
<platform>/build-cross/	build directory for cross tools
<platform>/build-target/ build directory for target tools
<platform>/images/	'ptxdist images' creates tarballs and
			filesystem images in this directory.
<platform>/sysroot-target/ target related libs and headerfiles are going to
			this dir
<platform>/sysroot-cross/ target related tools, but must run on host are
			going to this dir
<platform>/sysroot-host/ host related tools are going to this dir

<platform>/root/	root filesystem for the target
<platform>/state/	state files (show in which state packages
			currently are during the compilation)

For more details look at the output of 'ptxdist --help' or see the
PTXdist manual.
