	  Build ubi formatted image(s) for the root file system and an
	  optional data partition. UBI is faster and robuster than JFFS2,
	  we recommend strongly the usage of UBI if you want a file
	  system for raw flash devices. The image(s) can be directly
	  written to e.g. an mtd partition on a raw flash devices.
