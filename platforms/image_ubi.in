	  Build ubi formated image(s) for the root file system and an
	  optional data partition. UBI is faster and robuster than JFFS2,
	  we recommend strongly the usage of UBI if you want a file
	  system for raw flash devices. The image(s) can be directly
	  written to e.g. an mtd partition on a raw flash devices.

	  Create a root volume with the content of root.ubifs. You will
	  most probably want to activate this option is essential since
	  otherwise the final ubi image  will not contain a root file
	  system.

if IMAGE_UBI_ROOT_VOL

config IMAGE_UBI_ROOT_VOL_SIZE
	string
	prompt "root volume size"
	default "<invalid>"
	help
	  Give the root volume size here. You can use size unit like
	  "KiB" or "MiB".

	  The volume size must be greater than than the actual ubifs
	  file. Further the sum of all volumes in an UBI image should
	  be slightly smaller than the mtd device, to wich the image
	  will be flashed. The spare place is supposed to be used for
	  Jounal and other UBI header informations. We recommend a
	  ratio between spare place and the actual size of the mtd
	  partion at about 10% or higher. It is OK to define a big
	  amount of spare place. The UBI System will scan for available
	  space during first boot and expand the volume to the maximal
	  usable size after reserving internally used blocks.

	  An example: Our UBI image is supposed to contain a single "root"
	  volume. The mtd partition, onto which we will flash the UBI
	  image has a size of 32MiB. Our actual rootfs.ubifs has a size
	  of 16MiB. Than we should define our root volume size between
	  16MiB and 29MiB. We decide for 25MiB. During the boot process
	  the UBI system detects a mtd partiton of 32MiB. After reserving
	  2MiB for internal use it will expand our volume automatically to
	  30MiB.

config IMAGE_UBI_ROOT_VOL_NAME
	string
	prompt "root volume name"
	default "root"
	help
	  Give the root volume name here. Default is "root".
