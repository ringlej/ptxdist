[ ] OSELAS.BSP-Pengutronix-TechPool-trunk$ p select ptxconfig.dotgnu
    /home/rsc/svn/ptxdist-trunk/scripts/libptxdist.sh: line 26:
    /media/rscusb1_plain/svn/oselas/bsp/pengutronix/huettinger/OSELAS.BSP-Pengutronix-TechPool-trunk/ptxconfig:
    No such file or directory

[ ] liboldX fails to build the ipkg but the build continues!

[ ] Chrony fails to compile

[ ] rsc: fix 'ptxdist newpacket host'; find out what mkl intended with
    this "class" mechanism and make sure it produces sane output. Check
    with mkl.

    Example: ptxdist newpacket host-existing-target:

    - asks for version number, which should be derived from existing
      target version
    - asks for URL, but we want to use the download mechanics from
      target
    - should output warning that you have to change := into = for
      corresponding target packet

[ ] audit the logfile of AllYesArm for autotool calls
   [ ] util-linux: re-calls automake during compile;
   [ ] libxslt: re-calls automake during compile
   [ ] pure-ftpd: re-calls automake during compile

[ ] jbe: Adding "ant" to the required host tools. Emit a warning if its not
    present, but not fail (required only to build jvisu)

[ ] audit all packages if they change the target CPU (with --march or --mtune)
   [ ] openssl does so

---

[ ] rsc: audit if 'ptxdist get' fetches all packets correctly
    [ ] http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite-3.2.8.tar.gz does not exists any more
    [ ] ftp://ftp.leo.org/historic/comp/os/unix/networking/mgetty/mgetty1.1.30-Dec16.tar.gz
        503: Service Unavailable

[ ] update ChangeLog

[ ] rsc: after release: update OSELAS.Toolchain and OSELAS.Crosstool to
    use this version.

TODO for 0.10.x
===============

[ ] discuss UID of user "rpcuser"

[ ] discuss UIDs and GIDs of other important system users

[ ] jbe: reduce directory count on top level, combine build-* and
    local-* into a shared subdir rsc: we've agreed on this variant:

    	build-host/
	build-target/
	build-cross/
	local-host/
	local-target/
	local-cross/

[ ] repair make makro 'install'; there are sometimes three """.
    See procps.install for reference.

[ ] jbe: why does fam-2.7.0 always try to run the autotools? It fails on most
    modern systems -> mark as broken. rsc: real fix: find out why and fix.

[ ] jbe: replacing an *.make file for project use is easy. But how to
    replace a *.in file? rsc: no 0.10.6 issue, defer

    rsc: We have a problem with the dependency generator: if we have a
    packet which is already in ptxdist a second time in the local
    project, ptxdist includes _both_ .in files, resulting in the
    dependencies from the ptxdist version being superimposed on the
    local project ones.

    jbe: correct the ouput of "ptxdist menuconfig" when configuration is finished.
    The output of
    *** End of configuration.
    *** Execute 'make' to build the project or try 'make help'.
    is outdated...

    rsc: while doing this, update to a recent kconfig version, with
    saner colours instead of this unreadable yellow.

[ ] we seem to need python2.3-dev, reported by Marco Cavallini:

[ ] pureftp's configure runs twice and needs host's autotools!

[ ] Profiling support (kernel and userspace)
    best with host visualisation

[.] jbe: more help texts

[ ] if a packet is not selected, it's dependencies are not generated. If
    you kick a stage then, the dependend stages are not executed.
    Solution: generate the stages as well, so we get an error in that
    case.

[ ] Start a "Global Patch Repository Unification Project". Potential
    members:

    	* PTXdist
	* T2
	* OpenEmbedded
	  http://www.openembedded.org/repo/org.openembedded.dev/packages/
	* Gentoo
	* Debian
[ ] jbe: timezone files installation doesn't work as expected

[ ] jbe: if ipkg building crashes, PTXdist doesn't break. rsc: see
    pipeline error fixing in scripts/libptxdist.sh

[ ] rsc: ChangeLog automatism:
    http://www.simios.org/node/266?PHPSESSID=a736cf6396ad789e0148d9690761e733

[ ] ero: add -mcpu=... to PTXCONF_TARGET_EXTRA_CPPFLAGS, to let host tools
    definitely barf if they are accidently being built with the target
    compiler.

[ ] mol: ptxdist commands behave differently for arguments which exceed
    the "current" command; some continue parsing and some exit.

[ ] mol: add possibility to 'ptxdist print' more than one variable in
    one make call

[ ] check if ${PTXCONF_PREFIX} can be written to and barf if not

[ ] add sanity checks for all user configurable variables (especially
    paths)

[ ] audit project files for CROSS_AUTOCONF

[ ] Problem: When doing things like "PKG_CONFIG_PATH=bla something",
    something does not inherit the environment variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH.
    To achieve this properly, we need to export these variables to the
    calling shell. The same applies to lots of variables from
    Rules.make.

[ ] Write macros $(call compile) and $(call configure).

[ ] libxslt crypto support is broken

[ ] add menu entry for user local config files in /etc

[ ] image build mechanism tries to access data and infos from already
    disabled targets! (if they where enabled before). It does so
    unless a manually delete of the remaining and (now) useless targets
    in "state/"

Test suite components to be added
=================================

[ ] RSC: http://ltp.sourceforge.net/tooltable.php
[ ] RSC: Add more test suite stuff:
    http://gcc.gnu.org/install/test.html
    http://www.plumhall.com/stec.html
[ ] RSC: lmbench
[ ] RSC: add regression tests from crosstool

Old TODOs
=========

[?] JBE: http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=27363

[ ] bump bluez-utils/libs to 3.0 (needs dbus)

[ ] port scripts/mkprefix to non-perl

[ ] ptxdist arch <arm|um|ppc|....>

    Split build-target into build-${PTXCONF_ARCH}

[ ] Tree Structure
    RSC: Find sane place for generic files from projects/generic
    ERO: Make subdirectories, e.g. for x.org stuff. Might use symlinks
    to avoid changing the scripts.
    SHA: push make and in files into subdirs, add patches to that dirs
    as well.

[ ] Program Name Sorting
    JBE: Sort program entries in "Shell & Console Tools" and other menus by
    function, not by program name! Especially if there is more than one
    program that can do the job (see menu entries "Apache 1", "Apache 2" and
    "thttpd").  To be more concise the whole group should have a checkbox.
    Not until someone unlocks the "HTTP Server" group he can see the
    programs in this group.
    RSC: Please let's stay with alphabetic sorting in the menues. You
    don't find programs any more otherwhise. If the structure is not
    clear enough we should clean it up.

[ ] Graphical Configurator
    JBE:  For a graphical configurator instead of the ncurses one:
    Maybe ship a static linked "qconfig" version, otherwise the
    user also has to install the qt development libraries
    Same with ncurses (menuconfig), or the user has to be forced
    to install the development libraries for ncurses
    RSC: good idea, but only for customer packets. Maybe this will
    become obsolete when we have a good Eclipse based configurator.

[ ] JBE:  Make target "qconfig" starts target "oldconfig", even if
    the configuration was aborted! Target "menuconfig" doesn't

[ ] Startup Documentation
    JBE: add documentation to start from scratch with "make setup"
    this menu should provide the toolchain, all pathes to everything
    (also to a prebuilt toochain). All other targets should be project
    specific.

[ ] RSC: make projects doesn't find local_projects/something, if
    something is a softlink and not a directory.

[ ] RSC: replace perl by (modern) sed -i (hosttool)

[ ] RSC: Do ipkg stuff during make images

[ ] RSC: in NATIVE=1 mode libpthread.so.0 is not copied; find out why

[ ] MKL: let get stages depend on the actual makefile

[ ] RSC: Finish autotoolisation of chrony. The old features from the
    handwritten configure script have to be added; readline dependency
    is now temporarily fixed, it should be made optional again.

[ ] RSC:sed: replace all "sed" occurences by $(SED) and maybe switch to
    a newer GNU sed, which has to be packaged as a hosttool then.

[ ] RSC:Invent a project_clean mechanism (workaround done)

[ ] RSC:is "select GLIBC_DEBUG" in gdb.in necessary??

[ ] sandeep: add a script to setup a new project interactively

[ ] RSC: do module stuff in kernel only when modules are enabled
    in kernel configuration

[ ] RSC: audit bash for configure/menu entry consistency

[ ] RSC: bing outputs strange large numbers when being compiled for ARM
    :-) Add test suite for floating point.

[ ] RSC: port LTT-ng

[ ] RSC: Mozilla has still problems with cross compilation. See the
    following Bugzilla entries for possible solutions:
    http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=104541
    http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172651

[ ] RSC: add some useful statistics at the end of build (root size, image
    size etc.).

[ ] RSC: fix busybox extract script to support "select CONFIG_foo"

[ ] RSC: make MTDutils release and, by the way, fix build process.
    This "override" mechanism in the Makefile seems to be broken.
    MKL: mtdutils buildprocess fixed, splitted into 2 seperate file
    mtd.make and xchain-mtd.make 'override' seems to be working

[ ] RSC: audit all configure calls to be relative; configure scripts
    seem to have major problems when being called with absulute path

[ ] RSC: test flash

[ ] RSC: finish integration of iwconfig

[ ] RSC: add #ifdef __cplusplus ... #else ... #endif to bits/in.h

[ ] RSC: add .in file for xvkbd; integrate fixes for Makefile...

[ ] MKL: check openssl works with arm big endian (-DL_ENDIAN doesn't look good)

[ ] MKL: gmp3 cannot produce shared libc for ppc target (host i686-linux)

[ ] MKL: uclinux, patch breaks due to unclean produced patch at uclinux

[ ] MKL: test betaftp, old breaks due to a patch from DKE

[ ] MKL: test wxwindows

[ ] MKL: gawk fix prefix, due to hard coded path

[ ] MKL: integrate ldd (./build/glibc-2.2.5/elf/ldd.bash.in)

[ ] MKL: tweak wireless to xcompile

[ ] RSC: you currently need gdk-pixbuf-csource on the host

[ ] RSC: pango has a patch which has to be verified (GLIB_CFLAGS)

[ ] RSC: you currently need libXcursor.so.* and xcursorgen on the
    development host

[ ] RSC: replace bootdisk build mechanism by genext2fs; mke2fs is able
    to reserve N blocks at the beginning of the image!

[ ] KUB: busybox/ash job control is broken

[ ] RSC: add checksums for download

[ ] RSC: restructure config file layout

[ ] RSC: add a test: if #!/bin/sh scripts return
    "/bin/sh: bad interpreter: Permission denied"
    tell the user to look if his filesystem was monted
    with the "exec" option

[ ] RSC: check for uImage targets: have to depend on vmlinux, not on
    zImage.

[ ] LGR: concept for debug levels: strip, -g, -S

[ ] LGR: key infrastructure: integrate signing, activate this only
    when running the release cycle.

[ ] BBU: Implement scheme for alternative download-URLs as
    fallback (e.g. mirrors)

[ ] BBU: rsync URLs

[ ] BBU: show required cross-tool, host-gcc and -glibc-versions (compilercheck)

[ ] SHA: scripts/make_image_root.sh puts all ipkg packages from imagedir into the
    resulting images, even those which are lying there from old builds

DONE
----

[x] unbreak host-zlib; it is necessary for host-umkimage if there is no
    zlib devel packet installed on the host.

[x] omitting glibc installation should be possible, first hack attempt
    done

    Update 2007-01-12:	No idea what the reason was; we don't have a
    			concept for anything else than shared libs and
			glibc.

[x] rsc: fakeroot-the-hosttool seems not to be found - reported by wrap. It
    looks to me as if $(PTXDIST_WORKSPACE)/local/bin has to be included
    into the path somehow. Ask mkl.

[x] Our current host tools use their target counterparts for getting the
    sources; if the target counterpart is not selected, the dependencies
    are not created correctly! Test: switch off ipkg but activate
    host-ipkg.

[x] audit 'get' stage

[x] Menu Structure
    JBE: Use menuconfig instead of menu + configs whereever possible.
    It looks nicer in "menuconfig" and its much better supported when using
    "xconfig"

[x] ptxdist should reject working as ROOT

[x] add prerequisite checks to configure script; find out which
    prerequisites we really need.

[x] Toolchain selection
    JBE:  add an identifier to a (central) toolchain (in "make setup").
    It should be possible to use more than one toolchain in a local
    ptxdist folder (for different targets/projects). So the idetifier
    selects the right toolchain for this project. This identifier
    simplifies the toolchain selection. There could be a central
    folder in the system with all informations (and identifiers)
    about any available toolchain installed on this system.
	 --> done: "ptxdist toolchain path" per project

[x] discuss UID of user "nobody" and GID of "nogroup"

[x] jbe: ptxdist images fails for jffs2 fileimage creation
	it seems local-host/sbin is not in the PATH

[x] jbe: procps.install stage fails with:

	make: Ungültige Option -- y
	make: Ungültige Option -- y
	make: Ungültige Option -- L
	make: Ungültige Option -- /
	make: Ungültige Option -- L
	make: Ungültige Option -- /

	Seems the install macro emits: make [...] CFLAGS=""" LDFLAGS=""" [...]

[x] jbe: udev needs rules to control permissions on device nodes; jbe
    currently writes docs for this.

[x] jbe/rsc: /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/nsswitch.conf:
    Find a solution to generate DNS configuration files from other sources
    like boardsetup (I have no clue what this means).
    "Then either have no resolv.conf at all (use /etc/hosts only), or generate
    resolv.conf from 'ptxdist boardsetup' information and generate a
    sane nsswitch.conf."

[x] rsc: check if we can update mtd-utils from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1; mkl has
    already prepared the patches; find out why the revision number was
    not bumped. mkl: 1.0.1 needs acl, so we stay with 1.0.0

[x] ssh: server start scripts are missing

[x] ssh: key gen mechanics needed

[x] dbus needs user messagebus -> /etc/passwd; jbe: needs other user,
    non-root; add this user to /etc/passwd. Debian has a user called
    "messagebus", we should do it the same way. Define a sane UID (ask
    jbe)

[x] rsc: find out why mkl added this new dependency mechanism which
    searches for ${${LABEL}_DIR}/.ptx-extract.

[x] rsc: merge mkl's host/cross/target-pkg-config fixes. We need this to
    have a proper x.org and host-dbus.

[x] jbe: make DHCP client useful on the target. Currently only the binary
    will be built and copied, but does not work on the target

[x] jbe: update DHCP tp 3.0.5 or correct path to 3.0.4

[x] jbe: creating links into non existent directories fails, but does
    not break the build!

    Update 2007-01-12:	rsc/mkl: the install_link macro has mkdir -p
			calls in all relevant places; should not
			happen -> jbe: retest.
