+# Of course, Automake must honor this variable whenever it calls a

+# therefore $ac_aux_dir as well) can be either absolute or relative,
+# depending on how configure is run.  This is pretty annoying, since
+# it makes $ac_aux_dir quite unusable in subdirectories: in the top
+# source directory, any form will work fine, but in subdirectories a
+# relative path needs to be adjusted first.
+#
+# $ac_aux_dir/missing
+#    fails when called from a subdirectory if $ac_aux_dir is relative

+#    fails if $ac_aux_dir is absolute,
+#    fails when called from a subdirectory in a VPATH build with
+#          a relative $ac_aux_dir
+#
+# The reason of the latter failure is that $top_srcdir and $ac_aux_dir
+# are both prefixed by $srcdir.  In an in-source build this is usually
+# harmless because $srcdir is `.', but things will broke when you
+# start a VPATH build or use an absolute $srcdir.
+#
+# So we could use something similar to $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing,
+# iff we strip the leading $srcdir from $ac_aux_dir.  That would be:
+#   am_aux_dir='\$(top_srcdir)/'`expr "$ac_aux_dir" : "$srcdir//*\(.*\)"`
+# and then we would define $MISSING as
+#   MISSING="\${SHELL} $am_aux_dir/missing"
+# This will work as long as MISSING is not called from configure, because
+# unfortunately $(top_srcdir) has no meaning in configure.
+# However there are other variables, like CC, which are often used in
+# configure, and could therefore not use this "fixed" $ac_aux_dir.
+#
+# Another solution, used here, is to always expand $ac_aux_dir to an

+  -V, --version           display version information and exit
+  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking...' messages
+      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
